### Terminal ###

This is where the magic happens.  

**colorblind.terminal** :: I only rock the dark theme with vibrant colors. 

To use this Terminal theme install [SIMBL 0.9.7](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) and save the [64 Bit Terminal Colors](http://github.com/timmfin/terminalcolours) plugin to:  
`~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/` (create the directory if it doesn't exist).
